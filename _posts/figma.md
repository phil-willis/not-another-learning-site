# Overview of figma

# Tips

## One sided borders

- So currently you cannot add a border (stroke) to just one side of a rectangle
- There is a hack for it, using the `inner shadow` effect
  1. Create a rectangle and select it
  2. In the right-side panel add an `Effect`
  3. Change the `Drop shadow` to `inner shadow`
  4. Change the width by clicking the `sun icon` change the `blur` to `0`
  5. Change the x/y values depending on what side you want your border to show
